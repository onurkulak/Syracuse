# Syracuse
CS 319 Project - Group 27

Syracuse is a turn based city-state building simulation game mainly inspired by the game series Tropico, Total War, Travian, Civilization, and Stronghold . The game gives the control of the Syracuse to the player which was an ancient city-state and regional power in Sicily during Hellenistic Period. Every turn in the game represents one month in real life. Basically, in the game, player will start with a barren colonial city and some raw material sources, as game progresses he will improve his city and trade resources to gain access new resources. As the player gets stronger he will step into new ages that will give him access to new buildings, soldiers, resources etc. Eventually, in the end player might get stronger enough to conquer whole Sicily from the hands of Romans and Carthaginians. However, this game is not a sandbox game, player will have to deal with extremely strong foreign empires, his unhappy revolting society, his popular generals who might overthrew him from the throne, economic crisis, sieges, naval blockades, mercenary revolts etc. In Syracuse player starts as the smallest fish in the sea, and only if he plays wise, he will survive in this age of turmoil.
