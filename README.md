CS 319 Project

Syracuse is a city-state building game with an antique world setting. Player is in charge of a Greek colonial city in Sicily during the Punic Wars which initial raw resources are randomly generated. Player can improve the city by constructing buildings, selling and processing his raw resources while synergising different bonuses, in a Simcity-like play style. However the threat of being invaded by Carthage or Rome is always forces player to make diplomatic moves, meet these great powers requests. Basicly game has a grand diplomatic strategy layer where you can trade with other states like Egypt and Selecuids, declare wars, or accomplish missions, and a city-building economical level where you can build mines, farms, temples et cetera. Game can finish when one of the different victory conditons are satisfied, these might be building a great temple in the city, having certain amount of resources, or might be conquering whole Sicily and driving of Carthaginians and Romans.
