# Syracuse
CS 319 Project - Group 27

Syracuse is a city-state building game with an antique world setting. Player is in charge of a Greek colonial city in Sicily during the Punic Wars in which initial raw resources are randomly generated. Player can improve the city by constructing buildings, selling and processing the city's raw resources while synergising different bonuses, in a Simcity-like play style. However, the threat of being invaded by Carthage or Rome is always present and forces the player to make diplomatic moves, and meet the super power's requests. Basically the game has a grand diplomatic strategy layer where you can trade with other states like Egypt and Selecuids, declare wars, or accomplish missions, and a city-building economical level where you can build mines, farms, temples et cetera. Game will finish when one of the different victory conditons are satisfied. This might be building a great temple in the city, having certain amount of resources, or conquering the whole of Sicily and driving off the Carthaginians and Romans.
